# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview (EREASE)

In this challenge, we will be using python and pandas library to create a summary dataframe where we can visualize some important data from the collection of an app. Sorting data for a better visualization can give useful information to make analyses of, the weekly fares for different types of cities are going to be displayed on a line chart through the first quarter of the year 2019 and an evaluation of directions related to that data will be summarized.

Pandas library will be helpful to organize our dataset and present it in a clear way, then we''l use 'matplotlib.pyplot' functions to make a graphical interpretation of the data. By means of 'groupby()' function and some styling properties, it can be presented the results.  

# Results 
CHANGE. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

# Summary

CHANGE Written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
