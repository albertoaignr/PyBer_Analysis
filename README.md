# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

In this challenge, we will be using python and pandas library to create a summary dataframe where we can visualize some important data from the ride-sharing data of an app. Sorting data for a better visualization can give useful information to make analyses of, the weekly fares for different types of cities are going to be displayed on a line chart through the first quarter of the year 2019 and an evaluation of directions related to that data will be summarized.

Pandas library will be helpful to organize our dataset and present it in a clear way, also with 'matplotlib.pyplot' functions to make a graphical interpretation of the data. By means of 'groupby()' function and some styling properties, results will be acknowledged.  

# Results 

It will be presented the summary table from the data, where it can be easy to view some information for the different city types.

From this summary, we could say that Urban cities have more amassed volume of clients than the Rural or Suburban. also the difference in total drivers and rides represents the competitivity in the market for the usage of the app.

Though it is a nice representation of the results, this 'fare' value is fluctuating over time. To get a better view of how this value changes, a cropped representation will be shown. Where data was filtered to display the first quarter of the year 2019 and a line chart showing the timelapse of the fares per city types is plotted.

In this plot similarly evident the usage of the app in Urban cities and that theres is a continuity in the variability over time that follows a similar trend for every type of city.

# Summary

CHANGE Written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
